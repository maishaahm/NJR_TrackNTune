# NJR Track & Tune

No Jackets Required is a Student Activities funded, music performance club at the University of Rochester. Each semester, NJR puts on two shows. Our Big Show and our House Show. We also host an ensemble showcase to present the hard work our ensembles have been putting in all semester.

This database is designed to manage and document students' participation in these events. It stores detailed information about members, including their personal details, musical preferences, instruments played, and the specific roles they have taken on in past performances.
